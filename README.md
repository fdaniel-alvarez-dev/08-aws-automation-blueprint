# 08-aws-reliability-security-gitops

A production-minded Database Reliability Engineering toolkit: HA lab, backup/PITR drills, and zero-downtime migration playbooks.

Focus: gitops


## Why this repo exists
This is a portfolio-grade, runnable toolkit that demonstrates how I approach database reliability work:
safe changes, predictable operations, and recovery you can actually trust.

## The top pains this repo addresses
1) Building a data platform people trust—reliable pipelines, clear ownership, data quality checks, and governance that scales without slowing delivery.
2) Replacing manual, risky changes with automated delivery—repeatable infrastructure, safe deployments, and drift-free environments (IaC + CI/CD + GitOps).
3) Making databases boring again—high availability, predictable performance, safe backups, and zero/low-downtime migrations with solid tooling and runbooks.

## Quick demo (local)
Prereqs: Docker + Docker Compose.

```bash
make demo
```

What you get:
- a Postgres primary + replica setup
- PgBouncer for connection pooling
- scripts to verify replication and run backup/restore drills

## Design decisions (high level)
- Prefer drills and runbooks over “tribal knowledge”.
- Keep the lab small but realistic (replication + pooling + backup).
- Make failure modes explicit and testable.

## What I would do next in production
- Add PITR with WAL archiving + periodic restore tests.
- Add SLOs (p95 query latency, replication lag) and alert thresholds.
- Add automated migration checks (preflight, locks, backout plan).

## GitOps (what is real in this repo)

This repository includes a small GitOps-style Kubernetes example under `gitops/` that is designed to be:
- safe by default (securityContext, network policy, least privilege defaults)
- reviewable (plain YAML + kustomize layout)
- testable (static validation in `demo` mode)

Validate the GitOps manifests locally:

```bash
make gitops-validate
```

## Security validation (local, demo-safe)

Run the local security hygiene checks:

```bash
make security-validate
```

## Test modes (demo vs production)

This repository supports exactly two test execution modes controlled by `TEST_MODE`:

- `demo`: runs **mocked/static** checks only (no Docker, no external calls)
- `production`: runs **real integration** checks when correctly configured (Docker Compose)

Run demo-mode tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run production-mode tests (guarded):

```bash
PRODUCTION_TESTS_CONFIRM=1 make test-production
```

If production prerequisites are missing, the runner prints a precise list of what to set/install.
